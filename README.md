Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. The two variables that had the most amount of random variance are ground_clearance and vehicle_length.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope is not zero based on the p-value which is less than 0.05%

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This Model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the R squared value is approximately 71%

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both within design specifications with variances of 0.98 and 7.47 respectively. Lot 3 shows the most variance with a variance of 170.29
and exceeds the manufacturers specs.
